  <p>Hello there! I’m Alika Cynthia Clarissa, a penultimate electrical engineering student from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). Let me take you on a short journey that reflects my unique passion. Imagine stepping into a world where the whirr of futuristic technology and the nostalgic clank of steampunk innovation dance together in harmony—a world that ignited my love for all things engineering. It all began with the innocent wonder sparked by Baymax, the lovable healthcare companion from the realms of fiction. Little did I know, that fascination would blossom into a profound curiosity for engineering. Especially with how stuffs work, both electrically and mechanically. Although, my ultimate aspiration as well as my childhood dream has always to be able to contribute at NASA. The thought of being part of a team that explores the cosmos and pioneers groundbreaking technologies sends shivers down my spine. This dream isn't just about reaching for the stars; it's about bringing the stars within reach for those who dare to dream, no matter their physical constraints. </p>
  
  <p> My journey into the world of engineering is not merely a career choice; it's a heartfelt mission inspired by the very fabric of my family's experiences. Having loved ones facing physical challenges brought home the realization that technology could bridge gaps and improve lives. Their struggles ignited a spark within me—a determination to use my skills to create solutions that enhance human quality of life. I want to make a technology like that. It's not just about circuits and gears; it's about making a tangible, positive impact on the lives of individuals facing challenges, just like my own family. </p>
