  <h1 class="page-title">Projects</h1>
  <h2 id="bass-boost-audio-filter">BASS-BOOST AUDIO FILTER</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Successfully developed a bass-boost filter that amplifies frequencies below 200 Hz by 40 dB and attenuates frequencies above 4000 Hz by -20 dB. Implemented this design through various approaches, including 16th-order FIR filters with coefficients generated using MATLAB, showcasing advanced convolution techniques. Demonstrated a deep understanding of filter theory by designing an IIR filter with hand-calculated coefficients.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="linear-predictive-coding">LINEAR PREDICTIVE CODING</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrated exceptional proficiency in maintaining high fidelity in voice coding using MATLAB, achieving a remarkable 20% reduction in signal deviations through the implementation of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and advanced data compression algorithms. This resulted in near-lossless voice experiences in telecommunications, broadcasting, and other critical domains.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rupin-smart-room">RUPIN, SMART ROOM</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Developed an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) system for smart room automation, utilizing Arduino UNO and several sensors resulting in a 30% reduction in energy consumption through the implementation of automatic lighting and temperature control.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bjt-amplifier">BJT AMPLIFIER</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mastered advanced SPICE simulations and circuit analysis techniques to design and optimize BJT amplifier PCBs, achieving a 25% increase in efficiency and a 20dB gain boost in common emitter configuration. Successfully mitigated thermal instability issues in a high-power design, resulting in a 20% reduction in operating temperature and improved long-term reliability</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="securing-uav-communication-with-tinyjambu-on-fpga">SECURING UAV COMMUNICATION WITH TINYJAMBU ON FPGA</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Enhance the overall resilience and reliability of UAV communication networks by implementing the TinyJAMBU algorithm for encryption and decryption on a Xilinx FPGA using Verilog. This involved a comprehensive understanding and analysis of TinyJAMBU algorithm specifications, translating the algorithm into a hardware description language (HDL), optimizing the design for performance and resource utilization, and seamlessly integrating the algorithm into a secure communication system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trash-ure-smart-trash-bin">TRASH-URE, SMART TRASH BIN</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Designed a prototype for TRASH-URE, a smart trash bin implementation using SOLIDWORKS for CAD design and Tinkercad for circuit simulation. The smart trash bin is developed with purpose to significantly elevates recycling efficiency by segregating waste into dedicated sections within the bin. Advanced sensors are implemented by utilizing light for intelligent differentiation between metal and non-metal trash, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy rate in material classification.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="raja-ofu-a-biomimetric-robot-for-energy-management-system">RAJA OFU, A BIOMIMETRIC ROBOT FOR ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed RAJA OFU, a biomimetric robot for energy management system. The robot was designed to navigate diverse terrains, deploying its advanced capabilities to extract air from landfills. RAJA OFU utilizes air-stripping technology to meticulously separate methane—an abundant resource in landfills—from the collected air</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lobsmart-smart-pond-monitoring-for-lobster-cultivation">LOBSMART, SMART POND MONITORING FOR LOBSTER CULTIVATION</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed LOBSMART, a cutting-edge smart pool monitoring system designed specifically for lobster cultivation. LOBSMART also utilizes embedded systems to enhance the efficiency of lobster farming by monitoring critical parameters such as water quality, temperature, and environmental conditions to facilitate real-time data exchange, contributing to significant improvements in lobster health and farm productivity. Implemented Internet of Things (IoT) systems with MQTT, a lightweight messaging that minimizes data footprint, ideal for remote farm environments with potentially unreliable or bandwidth-constrained connections.</li>
